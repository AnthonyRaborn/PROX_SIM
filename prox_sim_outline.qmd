## PROX Simulation Outline

This simulation will compare the recovery of simulated ability parameters using different ability estimation functions with fixed item parameter estimates. The PROX method [@cohen1972] will be compared to:

-   (insert estimations here)

The comparisons between these estimation methods will look at different distributions of person abilities and different sample sizes of responses. The different levels of these factors are:

-   Person abilities:
    -   A standard normal distribution, $\theta \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1)$
    -   $\theta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 2)$
    -   $\theta \sim \mathcal{N}(-2, 1)$
    -   $\theta \sim \mathcal{N}(2, 1)$
    -   A bimodal mixture distribution with equal $\sigma^2 = 0.5$ and modes $\mathcal{Mo}_1 = -1$ and $\mathcal{Mo}_2 = 1$
-   Sample sizes:
    -   $n = 200$
    -   $n = 1000$
