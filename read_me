This repo contains the code and assocaited documentation for a PROX simulation for NCME 2023.

The basic idea is to create several simulated examinee distributions of different skewness and sample size to investigate the conditions under which the PROX estimation methods holds, compared to other estimation methods (e.g., JMLE, CMLE, MMLE).
